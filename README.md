# Airline_management using Python

## AIR TICKET RESERVATION

### BRIEF OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

The main objective of the python project on Air ticket reservation is to manage the details of booking, payments, seats, and flights.
The project is totally built at administrative end and only administrator is guaranteed the access. 
The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the booking, discounts,  seats, and payments. 
It tracks all the details about seats,  flight, and payments; it also prints various reports as per input given by the user.
### INPUT DATA  AND VALIDATION  OF  PROJECT
1.	All the fields such as flight  payments discounts are validated and does not take invalid values.
2.	Each form of sales, discounts, bookings cannot accept the blank values.
3.	Avoiding errors in data.
4.	Controlling amount of input.
### SOFTWARE  AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
Data file handling has been effectively used in the program. The database is a collection of interrelated data to serve multiple applications. That is database programs create files of information. So we see that files are worked with most, inside the program.
#### DBMS: The software required for the management of data is called as DBMS. It has3 models:
• Relation model
• Hierarchical model
• Network model
#### RELATIONAL MODEL: It’s based on the concept on relation. Relation is the table that consists of rows and columns. The rows of the table are called tuple and the columns of the table are called attribute. Numbers of rows in the table is called as cardinality. Number of columns in the table is called as degree.
#### HIERARCHICAL MODEL:In this type of model, we have multiple records for each record. A particular record has one parent record. No chide record can exist without parent record. In this, the records are organized in tree.
#### NETWORK MODEL: In this, the data is represented by collection of records and relationship is represented by (ink or association.
### CHARACTERISTICS OF DBMS:
• It reduces the redundancy
• Reduction of data in inconsistency
• Data sharing
• Data standardization
### DIFFERENT TYPES OF FILES: -BASED ON ACCESS:
• Sequential file
• Serial file
• Random (direct access) file BASED ON STORAGE:-
• Text file
• Binary File

## NEED OF COMPUTERISATION
Over the decades computers and air ticket bookings have developed gradually, changed with time. But nobody knew that a time will come when both these fields will complement each other so well. Today air ticket booking has reached new heights by computer aided methods of design. As a result of which, computer industry has got its new customer. Computer technology is making waves in the flight booking zone. Computers are a vital component of the ticket booking counters. Computer aided design (CAD) programs reduce the demand for manual sketches. New software programs continue to replace old manual skills. Those who lag in math can now breathe a little easier.Manually figuring of tickets insists that knowledge. Software programs constantly evolve. A program used today may be obsolete within several years. Being trained on today's software does not guarantee it will be used when you are ready to go out into the field. Understanding calculations is timeless, as is computer competency. Software, however, shifts rapidly.
## ADVANTAGES
1.	It generates the report on sales, discounts and flights.
2.	Provides filter report on payments and flight booking.
3.	We can easily export PDF on sales, products and stocks.
4.	Applications can also provide excel export for bookings and discounts.
5.	It deals with monitoring the information and transaction of ticket bookings.
6.	It increases the efficiency of flight booking and discount.
7.	It has higher efficiency of editing, adding and updating of records.
8.	Provides the searching facilities on various factors.
## LIMITS
1.	Excel export has not been developed for bookings.
2.	The transactions are executed in offline mode only.
3.	Online transactions for sales, bookings, or other data modifications are not possible.
4.	Offline reports of sales, bookings, and discounts cannot be generated due to batch mode execution.

## Future enhancements

1.	The solutions are given as a proposal. The suggestion is revised on user request and optimal changes are made. This loop terminates as soon as the user is gratified with the proposal.

2.	So on the whole, system analysis is done to improve the system performance by monitoring it and obtaining the best throughput possible from it. Therefore system analysis plays a crucial role in designing any system.

3.	This is basically an interface of global distribute system to carry out reservation on desired airline from any place.

4.	Airline reservation system make the life of passengers very easy as they don’t  need to stand in queues for getting their seats reserved.

5.	 They can easily make reservation  of any airline just from a single system. On the other hand, it also remove an extra burden  from  the Airline Department as most of the passengers and travel agencies use this service instead of making reservations from the counters.
